4. **User Context**: Shows relevant data based on user role and ID

### Navigation
- **Header Navigation**: Browse Jobs, Post Job, Admin Panel
- **User Menu**: My Jobs, Saved Jobs, Account Management
- **Role-based Access**: Different views for candidates vs recruiters

### Search & Filtering
- **Text Search**: Filter jobs by title keywords
- **Location Filter**: Filter by Indian states
- **Company Filter**: Filter by specific companies
- **Real-time Results**: Instant filtering of dummy data
